<p><h1>Do you consider yourself more of a designer or developer (or something else, other answers are acceptable)?</p></h1>
    <h2>I feel i am more of a designer as well as a programmer. I am better being programmer than designer, I like to code and I love the feeling     of being able to control what I am trying to show.</h2>

<p><h1>What are you most interested in learning in this class?</h1></p>
    <h2>I am most interested in learning how to program maybe pictures and make things move like in video games, To learn how to be well versed in     javascript. I want to be proud of my coding.</h2>

<p><h1>What is good design?</h1></p>
    <h2>I think a good design is clean, or even "good looking", functional, and interesting. I think a good design will keep users on the site        .</h2>

<p><h1>What is good web design?</h1></p>
    <p><h2>A good web design is interactive, fun, quick, easy to navigate, and clean. Good webdesigns keep users on the site for many hours.</p       ></h2>

<p><h1>What are the good examples of conference/event web sites? Answer by listing at least two sites including each URL and why you chose the site.</p></h1>
    </h2>I think <a href= "StumbleUpon.com"></a> because this website launches anywebsite on any web broswer. It has a lot of interest that you can change. it's efficient, clean, and interactive. I think <a href= "jimcarrey.com"></a> is another good site. although it's not clean it's interactive and exciting. it          has many things for a user to play or to look for content. I believe it's one of the most creative websites on the internet. </h2>
